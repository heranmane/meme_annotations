Available at TrineDaydotcom and the usual sellers. Not since the large-scale infusion of scientists and engineers fleeing Nazi Germany has there been such a mass importation of intellectual labor from U.S. client states in Asia. One of the specialized tasks assigned to this group is to build the technetronic infrastructure for the new world order command and control system. Servitors of Empire shows how highly trained knowledge workers are being employed to bring sovereign nations such as the United States under centralized rule made possible through advances in bioscience, IT, engineering, and global finance. This book forces a fundamental rethinking of the Asian American elite, many of whom have attained top positions in business, government, academia, sciences, and the arts, and an honest discussion regarding the role Asian Americans will play in the new century as China and India loom ever larger in the world economic system. From The Journey Podcast 42. Darrell Y. Hamamoto: Go Around the Curators Kris: The basic people in the shadows, the secret society, is basically based in Europe, with a strong sister society in China [which] has a little brother in Korea. [And there are secret societies in Japan.] I see [them] taking natural conflicts and building them up for their own uses. The Russo-Japanese War in 1905 ‚Ä¶ was basically by the arms manufacturers ‚Ä¶ At the peace conference ‚Ä¶ you have a whole bunch of people from the arms industry and a whole bunch of people from Skull and Bones. Darrell: And after the end of the second [world] war, they found out that the ultimate in kinetic warfare, atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, would ruin beautiful Kyoto, if they ever bombed it. So they said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do it through technology. Techno-war.‚Äù We have moved now ‚Ä¶ to the genetic. ‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs what ‚ÄúThe Great Reset‚Äù is all about. It‚Äôs a new form of warfare against targeted swaths of humanity. And that was really the focus of my book, ‚ÄúServitors of Empire.‚Äù Who was going to replace the aged-out Paperclip people, the Germans, the Eastern Europeans, the White Russians? [I brought the importance of Asia front stage and central.]"

These new projects are additions to previous surveillance programs planned by Myanmar‚Äôs democratically elected government, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, which was ousted in the Feb 1, 2021 coup. The Chinese-built cameras are part of a long-term strategy by Beijing, which is supplying surveillance gear to other countries to curry favor."
